# codewars
This repository contains the solutions of the level 8 kyu katas from codewars
It is structured using folders
The organization takes the Tag next to Fundamentals (if exist) so we prevent that all katas are inside the same folder
Kata 1 - Fundamentals - Bugs > this kata is available in Bugs
Kata 2 - Fundamentals > this kata is available in Fundamentals since it does not have another tag
Kata 3 - Array - Fundamentals > This kata is available in Array
